<h1> Arun Ponnusamy </h1>
<p> Hey, This is Arun. I am a Software Engineer working on Image Processing, GPU
Computing and Performance Optimization. I am passionate about Computer Vision 
and Machine Learning. </p>

<p> I am a lifelong learner. Curious about everything. Simple. Calm. Open minded. 
I firmly believe anyone can learn anything if perseverance is in place.</p>  

<p>I like to read, write and travel to new places. I read online 
articles and watch youtube videos to keep up with what's happening in the tech space. Watch 
sensible movies and documentaries, listen to good music and podcasts to unwind myself. </p>

<p>I will be blogging here mostly around machine learning, computer vision and data science.</p>
