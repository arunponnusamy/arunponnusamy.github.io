	<p class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">This is from a long time 		Ubuntu user who recently picked up a MacBook Air for 	all the portability it has 	to offer.</p>

	<p class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">I am completely new to macOS. 	I had to look around and experiment to install all the packages I was enjoying on 	Ubuntu. I decided to put together a simple setup guide to get the deep learning 	environment (particularly for Computer Vision) up and running on macOS the easy 	way.</p>

	<p class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">I am documenting the process I 	followed to get things working. Some of the process may not be the efficient / 		optimized way but the goal here is to get the job done with minimal efforts / 		frustration.</p>
	
	<h2 class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">Target Audience</h2>
	
	<p class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">Someone coming from Ubuntu 		background, completely new to macOS, just want to set things up for deep learning 	and doesn’t want to feel <i>“I wish I didn’t pick up a MacBook”</I>.</p>
	
	<p class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 text-center">.    .    .</p>
		     
	<p class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">Following are the basic 		softwares/packages you need for deep learning. This is not an exhaustive list by 	any means. These are the basic things I work with for Computer Vision. Depending 	on your area of interest the list may vary.</p>
